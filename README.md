# Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning & SSL Certificate Analysis

This project is a machine learning-based web application to detect phishing websites using both URL-based features and SSL certificate metadata. It uses a trained model and provides an easy-to-use **Gradio interface** to check whether a given link is **legitimate** or **phishing**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔗 Accepts a raw URL as input
* 🧠 Uses lexical URL features + SSL certificate metadata
* 📜 Extracts SSL features like issuer, validity period, and self-signed status
* 🤖 Trained ML model (Random Forest / XGBoost / etc.) saved as a `.pkl` file
* 🌐 Gradio web interface (no backend deployment needed)
* ✅ Fast and lightweight prediction
* 📊 Built using Kaggle-curated phishing URL dataset

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs a URL.
2. `feature_extraction.py` extracts URL-based features (length, special chars, etc.).
3. Features are fed into a trained ML model (`phishing_model.pkl`).
4. Output shown on Gradio UI: ✅ **Legit** or ❌ **Phishing**

## Setup & Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detector.git
cd phishing-detector
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Gradio will open the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

## 🛡️ SSL Feature Extraction Example

```python
from ssl_features import get_ssl_features

features = get_ssl_features("example.com")
print(features)
```

---

## Model Training (Optional)

To retrain the model with new data:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will generate a new `phishing_model.pkl`.
